Groovy is a scripting language which takes inspiration from Python and Ruby and is
fundamentally interoperable with Java. Java programmers owe it to themselves to give
Groovy a close look!

In my opinion, Groovy's main detriment is the disorganized and relatively-unattractive
online documentation for the language. I believe that if it had the documentation of
Python or Ruby, it would be much more widely known.

So this is my attempt to bring more light onto this great programming language and point
you all to the resources that I have found especially helpful.
