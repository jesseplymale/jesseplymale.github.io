## About Me

I like to run. I used to do crazier things like half-marathons
but nowadays a 3 or 4 mile run is perfect for me.

I like to dance--but not solo! [Swing dancing](http://www.dsds.org)
and country dancing are my favorites.

I enjoy taking the free, high-quality courses provided by [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org). I've received statements of accomplishment for the following courses (and am working on more!):

*   [Introduction to Music Production](https://www.coursera.org/course/musicproduction)
*   [Introduction to Improvisation](https://www.coursera.org/course/improvisation)

## Faith

I believe we owe everything we are to God. All of us fall short
of his best--but thankfully he extends His forgiveness to all of us,
if we trust in His Son, Jesus Christ.

> But God demonstrates his own love for us in this:
> While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
