## Other Programming Miscellany

My primary expertise is in Java, but working in scripting languages has always been fun for me. I really caught the scripting bug when I encountered Python. This year, I've started digging into Groovy as well, and I really enjoy the fact that it combines a lot of the ease of Python as well as being fully-interoperable with all of my Java knowledge.

So [here's my ode to Groovy](/groovy).
