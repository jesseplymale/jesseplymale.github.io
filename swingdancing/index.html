<p>Swing dancing is a lot of fun--and there are dances in Dallas every week!</p>

<p>One of the best places to go is the historic Sons of Hermann Hall, located just east of downtown Dallas in Deep Ellum, which has a swing dance every Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Even if you haven't ever been interested in swing dancing, it is definitely something you should check out at least once. You don't have to bring a partner--there are always plenty of people to dance with. (I'm estimating that they have around 175 people a night during the summer!)</p>

<p>Here's a good introductory video that was taken during one of the Wednesday dances. <em>(At the beginning of the video, there's footage of the swing dance performance team doing some fancy moves. Don't worry--most people at the dance aren't at that expert level! The clips towards the middle and end of the video are a better representation of what the dance floor looks like every Wednesday.)</em></p>

<p>It only costs $8 to get in. That covers the following events of the evening:<p>

<ul>
    <li>8pm - 9pm: A basic swing lesson
    <ul>
        <li>
        For the dance, all the guys and girls get in a big circle with the instructors in the middle. Every few minutes during the lesson, the guys rotate to the next partner--so you get to dance with a bunch of different dance partners, and you definitely don't need to bring a partner with you to take the lesson.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>9pm - midnight: Swing dancing
        <ul><li>
        A lot of the experienced swing dancers arrive around 9pm, when the lesson is finishing up. The DJ starts spinning old-school big band tunes, and the dancing starts! Stay as long as you want--the dancing goes on till midnight. It's a friendly atmosphere and pretty much everybody is there to dance, so you'll rarely get turned down if you ask somebody if they'd like to dance!

<p>Dress is casual to semi-dressy. Many people wear blue jeans and a t-shirt. Quite a few girls wear skirts or dresses. But overall it is mostly not a very dressy place.<p>

<p>People are coming and going throughout the evening, so don't worry at all if you don't get there right at 8pm for the lesson or right at 9pm for the dance. (However, the lesson is good, so it helps to be there at the beginning so you don't miss anything.) Every week there are a lot of first-timers, so there's no need to feel shy about being a beginner!</p>

<p>Here's a map to Sons of Hermann Hall:</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Parking can become limited as the night goes on. The best place to park is in the small lot just across the street, east of the hall, at the corner of 1st Avenue and Elm St. However, there is parking along the streets and in a big lot at the southwest corner of S Trunk Avenue and Elm St.</p>
