<p>Swing dancing is a lot of fun--and there are dances in Dallas every week!</p>

<p>One of the best places to go is the historic Sons of Hermann Hall, which has a dance every Wednesday night.</p>

<p>It only costs $7 to get in. That covers the following events of the evening:<p>

<ul>
    <li>8pm - 9pm: A basic swing lesson</li>
    <li>9pm - midnight: Swing dancing</li>
</ul>

<p>People are coming and going throughout the evening. Don't worry if you don't get there right at 8pm for the lesson or right at 9pm for the dance. (Though the lesson is good, so it helps to be there at the beginning so you don't miss anything.)</p>
